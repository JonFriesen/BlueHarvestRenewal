==================

This was my second attempt at java game development. I developed this using the native java libraries. I quickly realized that to get any real performance I would have to move to a graphic library such as OpenGL.
I wrote the renderers from scratch and the tiled maps are made with Tiled.
Development on this particular project has been canceled. Iâ€™m sure I will be picking up similar project but starting from scratch using a better graphic library, or even game engine.
